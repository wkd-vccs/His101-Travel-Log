                    A city inside a city
                </h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        I’m standing in front of the gates of the Castra Praetoria, the fortified home of the emperor’s personal bodyguards. It’s not open to tourists like the Colosseum, this place is serious. Massive stone walls tower over me, 
                        lined with guards in polished armor who eye me like I don’t belong. And, well… I don’t. But I’ve snuck my way inside.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Inside the camp, everything is organized with military precision. Rows of barracks stretch down straight roads, clean and efficient. You can practically feel the discipline in the air. Soldiers march in sync, their sandals slapping the stone in sync, not one step out of rhythm. 
                        No one here slouches or loafs around, they carry themselves like men who could be called into action at any second. The gates alone are wild. Massive oak doors reinforced with iron, flanked by sharp eyed sentries scanning the horizon from tall towers. 
                        They don't smile. I dont think its a good idea asking questions here.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A centurion barks orders at a group of recruits running drills in the yard. Their armor clinks with every move and sweat pours down their faces. The camp smells like iron, leather and men who haven’t seen a proper bath in days. 
                        I pass by weapon racks stacked with gladii and pila (those wicked throwing spears) and even a few ballistae being tuned up by engineers. It's a machine of war sitting just outside the heart of Rome. That building alone radiates authority. Everything from there down to the latrines(bathrooms) is perfectly ordered. 
                        I'd say these bathrooms were taken better care of than some dorms.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This isn’t some generic legion camp out on the frontier. This is the Praetorian Guard, the elite. The guys who protect the emperor, but also the same ones who have removed emperors when it suited them. 
                        I overhear two guards murmuring about a recent plot, and it hits me how much political power is housed inside these walls. After all, didn’t the Praetorians assassinate Caligula and auction off the throne to the highest bidder? Later, 
                        I sit in the hall with a few off duty soldiers. The food’s basic, with bread, olive oil and some meat which tasted quite nice with some wine. 
                        But for them, it’s luxury compared to what Rome’s poor get. They talk about their homes, their past campaigns and their loyalty to the emperor...
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      By the time night falls, the torches flicker along the camp’s walls and the guards swap shifts. I head back toward the city, the camp shrinking behind me. 
                        The camp shows off the discipline of the Roman organization… but also the empire’s greatest vulnerability, 
                        the fact that everything rests on keeping these soldiers happy.
