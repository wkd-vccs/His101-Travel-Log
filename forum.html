                    Heart of the Empire
                </h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        I step into the open plaza and immediately feel like I’ve walked into the center of Rome. The Roman Forum isn’t just a gathering space, its almost like the heart of Rome. Around me are massive columns, statues and basilicas buzzing with life. 
                        Politicians argue, merchants haggle and orators stand on platforms delivering speeches that echo between the marble walls.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I push through the crowd and find myself in front of the Rostra, the speaker's platform. Right now it’s being used for some speech about military victories in Dacia, but I know what used to be here. This is the same spot where they once nailed Cicero’s severed head after he was executed. Like, actually nailed them up for the public to see. 
                        I imagine looking up at them lifeless, still and feel sick. This isn’t just a stage for speeches, it’s a place where Rome puts fear on display.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Behind the speaker looms the Temple of Saturn, its towering columns casting long shadows. The temple's treasury once held the wealth of the Republic. Across from it is the Basilica Julia, a massive law court filled with people arguing over land disputes and contracts. 
                        You’d think this is just politics, but honestly it feels like theater. Too bad I dont have cellular service to post on social media.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The smells are a mix of incense from nearby temples, smoke from street food carts and the general funk of thousands of people in close quarters. Vendors shout at people passing by selling olives, figs and cheap trinkets. 
                        A pickpocket also bumps into me, how classic. I dont think they'll realize that my $5 is from the future.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       I spot a group of Vestal Virgins near the Temple of Vesta, their white robes flowing as they walk in a quiet formation. It’s surreal to see them up close, knowing how much religious power they hold in a society dominated by men. 
                        The temple’s eternal flame flickers inside, guarded day and night to protect the fate of Rome itself.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Everything here feels symbolic. Every statue, every step, every speech is significant. I realize this place wasn’t just the political core, it was a living stage for Roman identity. Suetonius wrote how emperors would walk the Forum to show themselves to the people. 
                        Power wasn’t just held in palaces, it was performed here daily and publicly.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As the sun lowers and the crowd begins to thin, I sit on a worn stone bench, just observing. The Forum isn’t quiet even at dusk. Someone plays a flute, a child laughs and a debate still rages outside a courthouse. 
                        It’s part of the night life.
                    </p>
