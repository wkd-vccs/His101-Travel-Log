                    <p>
                       Walking through one of the many entrances of the Colosseum, the screams of the crowd crashes over me. The whole place is overwhelming, the ground vibrating from all the noise, people pushing into entrances to get in, maybe I should've thought of coming earlier.
                        Sunlight beams through the open top, making god rays of light and making it look just like the movies. They haven't thought of hiring janitors because the leftover blood is still all over the place. It smells of sweat, dust and iron. You can hear the vendors shouting for your attention selling snacks but my dollars wont work here.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It’s the year 80 CE, and Emperor Titus has just opened the Colosseum with a grand celebration that includes 100 days of games. 
                        Around me, Roman citizens fill the stone seats, with patricians seated closest to the action, while slaves, women and foreigners are pushed to the higher levels, luckily I got access to the front. A trumpet then blasts silencing the crowd. The atmosphere is crazy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Soon, a procession enters: gladiators, heavily armed and gleaming in the sun with their notable helmets and bronze armor, followed by exotic animals in cages, 
                        they look well fed but still hungry for more. The crowd cheers. This is more than entertainment. It’s a spectacle that projects power. These games are about control, distraction and loyalty to the emperor. I remember that Suetonius wrote how emperors used these events to win public favor, 
                        and how the Colosseum stood as a gift from the Flavians to the people of Rome. More gladiators emerge from the gates below, while the others like the criminals wait for their fate in the shadows below us.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The architecture itself is breathtaking. The Colosseum was built using a combination of concrete, travertine, and brick, an engineering marvel with underground chambers
                        for staging complex battles and animal releases. Pliny the Elder would’ve admired the use of Roman ingenuity here, combining beauty, function and dominance.
                        As the combat begins, I realize why the Colosseum was essential to Roman Identity, Its not just bloodsport, but a way to show Roman values: courage in the face of death, 
                        skill in combat and the emperors power to grant life or death with a gesture. When the defeated gladiator falls, the crowds thumbs decide his fate, but the emperors will is supreme. In this moment 50,000 Romans participate in imperial power. 
                        I joined in with the crowd giving a thumbs up but now I cant help myself but feel uneasy. 
                    </p>    

                    <p>
                        As the sun sets and the final combat of the day ends after hours of bloodbath, I leave with the chattering of everyone talking about the games today and my ears still ringing from the chants. 
                        The Colosseum revealed that it wasn't just a building but a living symbol of political power and social hierarchy. The sand will absorb most of the blood leaving the deaths of the fighters forgotten.
